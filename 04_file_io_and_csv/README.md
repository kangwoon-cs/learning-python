# 04_file_io_and_csv

## ðŸ“Œ Concepts Practiced
- Opening and reading text and CSV files
- Writing new files and modifying content
- Using `Path` objects from the `pathlib` module
- Parsing lines using `.split(",")`
- Generating revised CSV outputs
- Basic CSV data transformation and formatting

## ðŸ“Ž Note
Some scripts here (e.g., `ExoTemperatures.py`, `flight_info.py`) rely on data files such as `exoplanets.csv` or `Airline_Delay_Cause.csv`.  
Make sure these files are present in this folder when running the code.
